### Battleships Board Game

A challenge at Makers Academy to practice Ruby programming, TDD and pair programming. The challenge is to recreate the Battleships board game.

In this challenge we are not going to implement the whole game (it's a one day task). We are going to concentrate on a few aspects of the game; the Board and the Player.

#### Technologies Used:

* Ruby
* TDD via Rspec

#### Things to improve:

Placement of ships on the board needs to be improved.
